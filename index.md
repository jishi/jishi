### Springworks (2016-2019)

Fullstack developer for a connected car platform (IoT). AWS-centric infrastructure, Android/iOS-client with a micro-services backend. Took lead on several major design decisions during my time there, which both reduced operational costs, complexity and developer time, e.g:

Moving into dockerized (ECS) service hosting
Utilizing SNS/SQS as a pubsub to reduce service complexity and de-couple producer / consumer reponsibilities

Most services were built in Node.js and MongoDB. AWS infrastructure handled with Cloudformation. In addition to this we ran Splunk, Postgres, Teamcity to name a few.
